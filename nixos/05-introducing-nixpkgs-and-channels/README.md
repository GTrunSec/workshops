# Overview

There are two ways to install packages with Nixpkgs: the [git checkout](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs), which is the bleeding edge, up-to-the-minute updated version, or by using channels. The git repository is ideal for people who want to use the latest and greatest available version of a package, or for those who want to test things out. [Channels](https://nixos.org/channels/) on the other hand, are essentially snapshots of the git repository at an earlier version.
